To accurately estimate pitch and roll angles, we combine readings from the 
gyroscope and accelerometer. Our algorithm is heavily based on the complementary
filter. We first enable the lowpass filter and set the sensor's antialiasing to
its smallest values to reduce accelerometer noise. We then take a windowed 
average of the accelerometer's angle estimates. When our window is full, then
we apply the complementary filter to estimate our angle. When our window is not 
full, we update our angle estimate by only integrating the gyroscope's angular 
velocity into the current angle estimate.
